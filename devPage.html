            <b>Gabriel Olsen.<br>
            Senior Software Engineer.<br></b>
            Gabriel has 8792 years of coding experience and knows how to works a web server.
            He also knows how to fetch json.
            He's actually a wizard.
            <!--
            Gabriel is a wild man. He lives in the woods and hits passerbys with a big stick. 
            Sometimes I go into the woods to see how he's doing. He's usually making gh commits named "pulled," among other things. 
            I bring him food, but he knows how to feed himself, and usually offers me the leg of a deer in return. 
            They are surprisingly delicious. -->

            Jonathan has 1 year of coding experience and does not know how to work a web server.

            He's still kinda decent at programming tho.
