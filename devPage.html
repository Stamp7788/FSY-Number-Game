            Senior Software Engineer.<br></b>
            Gabriel is a coding person and is quite muscular.
            <!--
            Gabriel is a wild man. He lives in the woods and hits passerbys with a big stick. 
            Sometimes I go into the woods to see how he's doing. He's usually making gh commits named "pulled," among other things. 
            I bring him food, but he knows how to feed himself, and usually offers me the leg of a deer in return. 
            They are surprisingly delicious. -->
